Student Performance Prediction

Overview
This project focuses on predicting student performance using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing educational data, conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training a classification model to predict final grades.

Features
- Data Preprocessing: Standardization, encoding of categorical features, and handling missing values.
- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA): Statistical summaries and visualizations.
- Machine Learning Model: Random Forest Classifier trained to predict student grades.
- Performance Evaluation: Accuracy score used to assess model effectiveness.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   
   "git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance-prediction.git"

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Upload the dataset (if required) and execute the cells step by step.

Results & Insights
- Feature preprocessing improved model performance.
- The Random Forest model was used to classify student performance.
- EDA provided insights into the factors affecting student grades.
